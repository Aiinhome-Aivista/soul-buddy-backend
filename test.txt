 Key Concepts in React: JSX, Components, Props, State, Lifecycle Methods, Hooks (useState, useEffect), Event Handling, Forms, API Integration.
- Best Practices: Keep components small and reusable, avoid prop drilling, use context for shared state, keep component structure simple, optimize performance with memoization and code splitting.
- TypeScript: Improves developer experience, catches errors before runtime, makes the code safer with types.
- API: Use GraphQL for flexibility and single endpoint, use axios for making requests.
- Error Handling: Use try/catch blocks to handle errors in API calls.
- Loading States: Display appropriate loading states when fetching data from APIs.
- UI Libraries: Material UI, Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI, Ant Design, ShadCN/UI offer prebuilt styled components and easy-to-use components for React projects.
